# Kaa
Kaa is a tool for reachability analysis of polynomial dynamical systems using parallelotope bundles.
It is a rewrite of the tool Sapo introduced by Dreossi, Dang, Piazza [(paper)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2883817.2883838)

## Dependencies
Kaa relies only on the following packages:

- sympy
- scipy
- numpy
- swiglpk

#Running sample models.

Run the Juypter notebook named kaa-intro to run a provided sample of models. The notebook contains all of the relevant code necessary to begin plotting the reachable sets and phase plots of a variety of models.
